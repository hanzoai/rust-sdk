# Vulnerabilities to ignore - these are transitive dependencies that cannot be easily upgraded
ignore = [
    # object_store 0.6.1 - AWS WebIdentityToken exposure in log files
    # Pulled in by vectordb -> lance. Upgrade blocked by lance compatibility.
    # Risk: Only affects AWS WebIdentity auth in error conditions
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0358",

    # ring 0.16.20 - AES functions may panic with overflow checking
    # Pulled in by multiple transitive deps (reqwest, rustls-old, hpke).
    # Risk: Only affects QUIC protocol or 64GB+ single-chunk encryption (not our use case)
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0009",

    # rustls 0.20.9 - complete_io infinite loop on close_notify during handshake
    # Pulled in by reqwest 0.11.x (used by object_store)
    # Risk: Only affects rustls::Stream, not tokio-rustls we use
